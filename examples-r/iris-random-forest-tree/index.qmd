This visualization breaks down one of the decision trees from a Random Forest model, showing how the algorithm makes predictions by splitting data based on key variables. Use this visualization in materials where you want to:

- Demonstrate AI and machine learning: Highlight how complex algorithms work in a way thatâ€™s approachable and visually engaging.
- Showcase decision-making processes: Use it to emphasize structured, data-driven insights in marketing or operational contexts.
- Illustrate innovation: Position it as an example of cutting-edge data science tools in fields like healthcare, finance, or business strategy.

When adapting the visualization, I recommend removing the figures and text. The shapes and general organization alone are sufficient to convey the visual structure.
