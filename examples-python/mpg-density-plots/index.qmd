A density chart of miles per gallon (mpg) provides a smooth and elegant way to visualize the distribution of vehicle fuel efficiency. Use this visualization in materials where you want to:
    
- Demonstrate analytical tools: Use it as an example of how to turn raw data into clear insights.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from plotnine import (
    ggplot,
    aes,
    geom_density,
    geom_histogram,
    after_stat,
    theme
)

from plotnine.data import mpg

(
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x="cty", color="drv", fill="drv"))
    + geom_density(aes(y=after_stat("count")), alpha=0.1)
    + theme(legend_position='none')
)
```
